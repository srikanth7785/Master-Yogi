# Master Yogi

A small working prototype for assisting the yoga practice developed for Build for Digital India, where the current Asana will be predicted..with a decent Accuracy..and the instructions for next one will be given..in text format along with the audio.

This app is developed using Flutter and integrated with the Machine Learning model which predicts the Asanas.

You can find the working prototype [here.](https://youtu.be/9ssw8qdaxAI)
